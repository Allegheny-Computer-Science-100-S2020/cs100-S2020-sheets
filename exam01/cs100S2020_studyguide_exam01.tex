\section*{Introduction}

\noindent
The exam will be ``closed notes'' and ``closed book'' and it will cover the
following materials. Please review the ``Course Schedule'' on the Web site for
the course to see the content and slides that we have covered to this date.
Students may post questions about this material to our Slack team.

\begin{itemize}

  \itemsep 0in

  \item Chapter One in Lewis \& Loftus (i.e., ``Introduction to Computation and
    Programming'')

  \item Chapter Two in Lewis \& Loftus, Sections 2.1--2.6 (i.e., ``Data and
    Expressions'')

  \item Chapter Three in Lewis \& Loftus, Sections 3.1--3.11 (i.e., ``Using
    Classes and Objects'')

  % These two chapters were not on the exam, but added to the examination

  \item Chapter Four in Lewis \& Loftus, Sections 4.1--4.9 (i.e., ``Writing
    Classes'')

  \item Chapter Five in Lewis \& Loftus, Sections 5.1--5.6 (i.e., ``Conditionals
    and Loops'')

  \item Using the commands in your laptop's operating system; using Docker
    containers; compiling and executing programs with Gradle; knowledge of the
    commands for using {\tt git} and GitHub.

  % \item Using the basic commands in the Linux operating system; editing in a
  %   text editor, building and running programs in Linux; knowledge of the basic
  %   commands for using {\tt git} and GitHub.

  % NOTE: We are way behind on the practical assignments this semester
  % NOTE: We are slightly behind on the laboratory assignments this semester
  % NOTE: By the time that this examination takes place, I might not have
  % finished grading the lab number 6

  \item Your class notes and lecture slides, labs 1--6, practicals 1--5, and the
    handouts from lab.

\end{itemize}

\noindent The exam will be a mix of questions that have a form such as fill in
the blank, short answer, true/false, and completion. The emphasis will be on the
following topics:

\vspace*{-.05in}
\begin{itemize}

  \itemsep 0in

  \item Fundamental concepts in computing and the Java language (e.g.,
    definitions and background)

  \item Practical laboratory techniques (e.g., editing, compiling, and running
    programs; effectively using files and directories; correctly using GitHub
    through the command-line {\tt git} program)

  \item Understanding Java programs (e.g., given a short, perhaps even one line,
    source code segment written in Java, understand what it does and be able to
    precisely describe its output).

  \item Composing Java statements and programs, given a description of what
    should be done. Students should be completely comfortable writing short
    source code statements that are in nearly-correct form as Java code. While
    your program may contain small syntactic errors, it is not acceptable to
    ``make up'' features of the Java programming language that do not exist in
    the language itself---so, please do not call a ``{\tt
    solveQuestionThree()}'' method!

\end{itemize}

\noindent No partial credit will be given for questions that are true/false,
completion, or fill in the blank. Minimal partial credit may be awarded for the
questions that require a student to write a short answer. You are strongly
encouraged to write short, precise, and correct responses to all of the
questions. When you are taking the exam, you should do so as a ``point
maximizer'' who first responds to the questions that you are most likely to
answer correctly for full points. Please keep the time limitation in mind as you
are absolutely required to submit the examination at the end of the class period
unless you have written permission for extra time from a member of the Learning
Commons. Students who do not submit their exam on time will have their overall
point total reduced. Please see the course instructor if you have questions
about any of these policies.

% \section*{Reminder Concerning the Honor Code}

Students are required to fully adhere to the Honor Code during the completion of
this exam. More details about the Allegheny College Honor Code are provided on
the syllabus available from the course web site. Students are strongly
encouraged to carefully review the full statement of the Honor Code before
taking this exam. So as to maintain your own integrity and that of the College,
the Honor Code requires you complete your own work during the exam. If you do
not understand Allegheny College's Honor Code, please schedule an office hours
meeting with the course instructor.

% \begin{quote}
%   The Academic Honor Program that governs the entire academic program at
%   Allegheny College is described in the Allegheny Academic Bulletin. The Honor
%   Program applies to all work that is submitted for academic credit or to meet
%   non-credit requirements for graduation at Allegheny College. This includes all
%   work assigned for this class (e.g., examinations, laboratory assignments, and
%   the final project). All students who have enrolled in the College will work
%   under the Honor Program.  Each student who has matriculated at the College has
%   acknowledged the following pledge:
% \end{quote}

% \begin{quote}
%   I hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as defined in
%   the Honor Code, and to maintain the integrity of both myself and the College
%   community as a whole.
% \end{quote}

% \noindent It is understood that an important part of the learning process in
% any course, and particularly one in computer science, derives from thoughtful
% discussions with teachers and fellow students. Such dialogue is encouraged.
% However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the student who
% discusses the principles underlying a problem with others and the student who
% produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone
% else's work.  While it is acceptable for students in this class to discuss
% their programs, data sets, and reports with their classmates, deliverables
% that are nearly identical to the work of others will be taken as evidence of
% violating the \mbox{Honor Code}.
