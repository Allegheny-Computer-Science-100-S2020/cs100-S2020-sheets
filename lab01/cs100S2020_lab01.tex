\section*{Objectives}

To learn how to use GitHub to access the files for a course assignment.
Additionally, to learn how to use your laptop's operating system and software
development tools such as a ``terminal window'' and the ``Docker Desktop''. You
will also continue to practice using Slack to support communication with the
technical leaders and the course instructor. Next, you will learn how to
implement a Java program and to write a Markdown document, also discovering how
to use the course's automated grading tool to assess your progress towards
correctly completing the project.

\section*{Suggestions for Success}

\begin{itemize}
  \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}

\item {\bf Follow each step carefully}. Slowly read each sentence in the
  assignment sheet, making sure that you precisely follow each instruction. Take
  notes about each step that you attempt, recording your questions and ideas and
  the challenges that you faced. If you are stuck, then please tell a technical
  leader or instructor what assignment step you recently completed.

\item {\bf Regularly ask and answer questions}. Please log into Slack at the
  start of a laboratory or practical session and then join the appropriate
  channel. If you have a question about one of the steps in an assignment, then
  you can post it to the designated channel. Or, you can ask a student sitting
  next to you or talk with a technical leader or the course instructor.

\item {\bf Store your files in GitHub}. Starting with this laboratory
  assignment, you will be responsible for storing all of your files (e.g., Java
  source code and Markdown-based writing) in a Git repository using GitHub
  Classroom. Please verify that you have saved your source code in your Git
  repository by using \command{git status} to ensure that everything is
  updated. You can see if your assignment submission meets the established
  correctness requirements by using the provided checking tools on your local
  computer and by checking the commits in GitHub.

\item {\bf Keep all of your files}. Don't delete your programs, output files,
  and written reports after you submit them through GitHub; you will need them
  again when you study for the quizzes and examinations and work on the other
  laboratory, practical, and final project assignments.

\item {\bf Explore teamwork and technologies}. While certain aspects of the
  laboratory assignments will be challenging for you, each part is designed to
  give you the opportunity to learn both fundamental concepts in the field of
  computer science and explore advanced technologies that are commonly employed
  at a wide variety of companies. To explore and develop new ideas, you should
  regularly communicate with your team and/or the student technical leaders.

\item {\bf Hone your technical writing skills}. Computer science assignments
  require to you write technical documentation and descriptions of your
  experiences when completing each task. Take extra care to ensure that your
  writing is interesting and both grammatically and technically correct,
  remembering that computer scientists must effectively communicate and
  collaborate with their team members and the student technical leaders and
  course instructor.

\item {\bf Review the Honor Code on the syllabus}. While you may discuss your
  assignments with others, copying source code or writing is a violation of
  Allegheny College's Honor Code.

\end{itemize}

\section*{Reading Assignment}

If you have not done so already, please read all of the relevant ``GitHub
Guides'', available at \url{https://guides.github.com/}, that explain how to use
many of the features that GitHub provides. In particular, please make sure that
you have read guides such as ``Mastering Markdown'' and ``Documenting Your
Projects on GitHub''; each of them will help you to understand how to use both
GitHub and GitHub Classroom. To do well on this assignment, you should also read
Chapters 1 and 2 in the course textbook, paying close attention to Sections 1.4
and 1.5 and 2.1. Please see the instructor or one of the technical leaders if
you have questions these reading assignments.

\section*{Configuring Git and GitHub}

\marginnote{\resource{Learn about GitHub}}[.75in] During this laboratory
assignment and the subsequent laboratory and practical assignments, we will
securely communicate with the GitHub servers that will host all of the project
templates and your submitted deliverables. In this assignment, you will perform
all of the steps to configure your account on GitHub and you will start your
first assignment using GitHub Classroom. Throughout this assignment, you should
refer to the following web sites for more information:
\url{https://guides.github.com/} and, in particular,
\url{https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/}. You can also learn more
about GitHub Classroom by visiting \url{https://classroom.github.com/}. As you
will be required to use Git, an industry standard tool, in all of the remaining
laboratory and practical assignments and during the class sessions, you should
keep a record of all of the steps that you complete and the challenges that you
face. You may see the course instructor or one of the technical leaders if you
are not able to complete a certain step or if you are not sure how to proceed.

\begin{enumerate}

  \item If you do not already have a GitHub account, then please go to the
    GitHub web site and create one, making sure that you use your
    \command{allegheny.edu} email address so that you can join GitHub as a
    student at an accredited educational institution. You are also encouraged
    to sign up for GitHub's ``Student Developer Pack'' at
    \url{https://education.github.com/pack}, qualifying you to receive free
    software development tools. Additionally, please add a description of
    yourself and an appropriate professional photograph to your GitHub profile.
    Unless your username is taken, you should also pick your GitHub username to
    be the same as Allegheny's Google-based email account. Now, in the
    \channel{#labs} channel of our Slack team, please type on one line your
    full name, \command{allegheny.edu} email address, and your new GitHub
    username. If you have already typed this information into Slack during a
    prior class, you do not need to do so again.

  \item If you have never done so before, you must use the \command{ssh-keygen}
    program to create secure-shell keys that you can use to support your
    communication with GitHub. But, to start, this task requires you to type
    commands in a program that is known as a terminal.
    %
    Your terminal program will vary depending on your operating system. For
    instance, if you are running Linux, you can click on an icon that contains
    the \command{>} symbol or press the ``Super'' key, start typing the word
    ``terminal'', and then select that program. Another way to open a terminal
    involves typing the key combination \command{<Ctrl>-<Alt>-t}.
    %
    On the Windows operating system you may want to use the ``Command Prompt''
    or the ``Power Shell'' and on MacOS you can use ``Terminal''.
    %
    Your terminal will display as a box into which you can type commands.
    %
    For the next step, you may need to separately install \command{ssh-keygen}
    if it is not on your laptop.

  \item \marginnote{\think{Understand SSH keys}}[.05in] Now that you have
    started the terminal, you will need to type the \command{ssh-keygen} command
    in it. Follow the prompts to create your keys and save them in the default
    directory. That is, you should press ``Enter'' after you are prompted to
    \command{Enter file in which to save the key ...  :} and then type your
    selected passphrase whenever you are prompted to do so. Please note that a
    ``passphrase'' is like a password that you will type when you need to prove
    your identify to GitHub. What files does \command{ssh-keygen} produce? Where
    does this program store these files by default? Do you have any questions
    about how to create your SSH keys?

  \item \marginnote{\caution{Upload keys correctly}}[.5in] Once you have
    created your ssh keys, you should raise your hand to invite either a
    technical leader or the instructor to help you with the next steps. First,
    you must log into GitHub and look in the right corner for an account avatar
    with a down arrow. Click on this link and then select the ``Settings''
    option. Now, scroll down until you find the ``SSH and GPG keys'' label on
    the left, click to create a ``New SSH key'', and then upload your ssh key
    to GitHub. You can copy your SSH key to the clipboard by going to the
    terminal and typing a command like ``{\tt cat
    \textasciitilde{}/.ssh/id\_rsa.pub}'' command and then highlighting this
    output. When you are completing this step in your terminal, please make
    sure that you only highlight the letters and numbers in your key---if you
    highlight any extra symbols or spaces then this step may not work
    correctly. Then, paste this into the GitHub text field in your web browser.

  \item Again, when you are completing these steps, please make sure that you
    take careful notes about the inputs, outputs, and behavior of each command.
    If there is something that you do not understand, then please ask the course
    instructor or the technical leader about it.

  \item Since this is your first laboratory assignment and you are still
    learning how to use the appropriate software, don't become frustrated if you
    make a mistake. Instead, use your mistakes as an opportunity for learning
    both about the necessary technology and the background and expertise of the
    other students in the class, the technical leaders, and the course
    instructor. Remember, you can use Slack to talk with the instructor by
    typing \command{@gkapfham} in a channel.

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Accessing the Laboratory Assignment on GitHub}

To access this assignment, you should go into the \channel{\#announcements}
channel in our Slack workspace and find the announcement that provides a link
for it. Copy this link and paste it into your web browser. Now, you should
accept the laboratory assignment and see that GitHub Classroom created a new
GitHub repository for you to access the assignment's starting materials and to
store the completed version of your assignment. Specifically, to access your
new GitHub repository for this assignment, please click the green ``Accept''
button and then click the link that is prefaced with the label ``Your
assignment has been created here''. If you accepted the assignment and
correctly followed these steps, you should have created a GitHub repository
with a name like
``Allegheny-Computer-Science-100-Spring-2020/computer-science-100-spring-2020-lab-1-gkapfham''.
Unless you provide the course instructor with documentation of the extenuating
circumstances that you are facing, not accepting the assignment means that you
automatically receive a failing grade for it.

\marginnote{\caution{Clone GitHub repository}}[.75in] Before you move to the
next step of this laboratory assignment, please make sure that you read all of
the content on the web site for your new GitHub repository, paying close
attention to the technical details about the commands that you will type and
the output that your program must produce. Now you are ready to download the
starting materials to your laboratory computer. Click the ``Clone or download''
button and, after ensuring that you have selected ``Clone with SSH'', please
copy this command to your clipboard. At this point, you can open a new terminal
window and type the command \command{mkdir cs100F2020}. To enter into this
directory you should now type \command{cd cs100F2020}. Next, you can type the
either \command{ls} (on either MacOS or Linux) or \command{dir} (on Windows 10
Pro or Windows 10 Enterprise) and see that there are no files or directories
inside of this directory. By typing \command{git clone} in your terminal and
then pasting in the string that you copied from the GitHub site you will
``download'' all of the code for this assignment. For instance, if the course
instructor ran the \command{git clone} command in the terminal, it would look
like:

\begin{lstlisting}
  git clone git@github.com:Allegheny-Computer-Science-100-F2020/computer-science-100-spring-2020-lab-1-gkapfham.git
\end{lstlisting}

\marginnote{\discuss{Use terminal commands}}[.5in] After this command finishes,
you can use \command{cd} to change into the new directory. If you want to
\step{go back} one directory from your current location, then you can type the
command \command{cd ..}.  Finally, please continue to use the \command{cd} and
\command{ls} commands to explore the files that you automatically downloaded
from GitHub. If one of the aforementioned commands does not work correctly, then
it is possible that your terminal window is not up-to-date or not configured
correctly. In this case, please share your specific error messages with the
instructor, ultimately working to master the use of terminal commands. What
files and directories do you see? What do you think is their purpose? Spend some
time exploring, telling your discoveries to a \mbox{student technical leader}.

\section*{Displaying Output with a Java Program}

% Introduce the use of Docker and the use of Gradle inside of Docker

Once you have installed Docker Desktop, you can use the following
\command{docker run} command to start \command{gradle grade} as a containerized
application, using the ``DockaGator'' Docker image available on DockerHub. You
can run the following command to run the \command{gradle grade} on your project:

\begin{verbatim}
docker run --rm --name dockagator \
  -v "$(pwd)":/project \
  -v "$HOME/.dockagator":/root/.local/share \
  gatoreducator/dockagator
\end{verbatim}

The aforementioned command will use \program{"\$(pwd)"} (i.e., the current
directory) as the project directory and \program{"\$HOME/.dockagator"} as the
cached GatorGrader directory. Please note that both of these directories must
exist, although only the project directory must contain some content. Generally,
the project directory should contain the source code and technical writing for
this assignment, as provided to you through GitHub during the completion of a
previous step. Additionally, the cache directory should not contain anything
other than directories and programs created by DockaGator, thus ensuring that
they are not otherwise overwritten during the completion of the assignment. To
ensure that the previous command will work correctly, you should create the
cache directory by running the command \command{mkdir \$HOME/.dockagator}; you
will only need to do this once. If the above \command{docker run} command does
not work correctly on the Windows operating system, then you may need to instead
run the following command to work around limitations in the terminal window:

\begin{verbatim}
docker run --rm --name dockagator \
  -v "%cd%:/project" \
  -v "%HomeDrive%%HomePath%/.dockagator:/root/.local/share" \
  gatoreducator/dockagator
\end{verbatim}

This laboratory assignment invites you to implement a Java program that
displays exactly four lines of output. The first output line should display
your name and then today's date. The next three lines should each display
specific statements that the program must share with the person running your
program. You can accomplish the first task by typing
\command{System.out.println("Gregory M. Kapfhammer " + new Date());},
substituting your name for the name of the course instructor. Your program will
produce three additional lines of output once you modify three more
\command{System.out.println} statements. When you are finished typing text in
your text editor, make sure to save your program. Leaving the text editor's
window open, go back to your terminal window. Now, you are ready to learn to
use new tools that build and run your program and check its correctness!

Since your laptop normally would not have software development tools installed
on it, you should use the Docker container to run the following commands. To
enter into an ``interactive terminal'' in the Docker container, you can add
\command{-it} before \command{--rm} and \command{/bin/bash} to the end of the
previous \command{docker run} command that you typed. If you are stuck on this
step, check your GitHub repository's documentation for more details! Now, if
you want to \step{build} your program you can type the command \gradlebuild{}
in your terminal, thereby causing the Java compiler to check your program for
errors and get it ready to run. If you get any error messages, go back into
your text editor and try to figure out what you mis-typed and fix it. Once you
have solved the problem, make a note of the error and the solution for
resolving it. Re-save your program and then build it again by re-running the
\gradlebuild{}. If you cannot build \mainprogram{} correctly, then please
discuss any challenges with a student technical leader or the course
instructor.

\marginnote{\think{Reflect on challenges}}[.75in] When all of the errors are
eliminated, you can run your program by typing \gradlerun{} in the terminal
window---this is the ``execute'' step that will run your program and produce
the designated output. You should see your name, today's date and three more
lines of text. Make sure there are spaces separating words in your output (did
you forget to put a space inside the quotation marks after your last name?). If
not, then repair the program and re-build and re-run it. Once the program runs,
please reflect on this process. What step did you find to be the most
challenging? Why? You should write your reflections in a file, called
\reflection{}, that uses the Markdown writing language. You can learn more
about Markdown by viewing the aforementioned GitHub guide. To complete this
aspect of the assignment, you should write one high-quality paragraph that
reports on your experiences. Now, verbally share your experiences with another
class member!

Since this is our first laboratory assignment and you are still learning how to
use the appropriate hardware and software, don't become frustrated if you make a
mistake. Instead, use your mistakes as an opportunity for learning both about
the necessary technology and the background and expertise of the other students
in the class, the technical leaders, and the course instructor.

\section*{Checking the Correctness of Your Program and Writing}

\marginnote{\resource{Study style guides}}[1in] As verified by Checkstyle
tool, the source code for the \mainprogram{} file must adhere to all of the
requirements in the Google Java Style Guide available at
\url{https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html}. The Markdown file
that contains your reflection must adhere to the standards described in the
Markdown Syntax Guide
\url{https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/}. Finally, your
\reflection{} file should adhere to the Markdown standards established by the
\step{Markdown linting} tool available at
\url{https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint/} and the writing standards
set by the \step{prose linting} tool from \url{http://proselint.com/}. Instead
of requiring you to manually check that your deliverables adhere to these
industry-accepted standards, the GatorGrader tool that you will use in this
laboratory assignment makes it easy for you to automatically check if your
submission meets the standards for correctness. For instance, GatorGrader will
check to ensure that \mainprogram{} produces exactly four lines of output and
that you use the \command{new Date()} construct in the Java source code to
cause the program to display today's date.

\marginnote{\caution{Write useful commits}}[.75in] To get started with the use
of GatorGrader, type the command \gatorgraderstart{} in your Docker container.
If your laboratory work does not meet all of the assignment's requirements, then
you will see a summary of the failing checks along with a statement giving the
percentage of checks that are currently passing. If you do have mistakes in your
assignment, then you will need to review GatorGrader's output, find the mistake,
and try to fix it. Once your program is building correctly, fulfilling at least
some of the assignment's requirements, you should transfer your files to GitHub
using the \gitcommit{} and \gitpush{} commands. For example, if you want to
signal that the \mainprogramsource{} file has been changed and is ready for
transfer to GitHub you would first type \gitcommitmainprogram{} in your
terminal, followed by typing \gitpush{} and checking to see that the transfer to
GitHub is successful. Please note that students can also use their text editor
to transfer their source code to GitHub. If you notice that transferring your
code or writing to GitHub did not work correctly, then read the errors in your
terminal window and please try to determine why, asking a technical leader or
the course instructor for assistance, if necessary.

\marginnote{\caution{Verify all checks}}[1in] After the course instructor
enables \step{continuous integration} with a system called Travis CI, when you
use the \gitpush{} command to transfer your source code to your GitHub
repository, Travis CI will initialize a \step{build} of your assignment,
checking to see if it meets all of the requirements. If both your source code
and writing meet all of the established requirements, then you will see a green
\checkmark{} in the listing of commits in GitHub after awhile. If your
submission does not meet the requirements, a red \naughtmark{} will appear
instead. The instructor will reduce a student's grade for this assignment if
the red \naughtmark{} appears on the last commit in GitHub immediately before
the assignment's due date. Yet, if the green \checkmark{} appears on the last
commit in your GitHub repository, then you satisfied all of the baseline checks,
thereby allowing the course instructor to evaluate other aspects of your source
code and writing, as further described in the \step{Evaluation} section of this
assignment sheet. Unless you provide the instructor with documentation of the
extenuating circumstances that you are facing, no late work will be considered
towards your grade for this laboratory assignment.

\section*{Summary of the Required Deliverables}

\noindent Students do not need to submit printed source code or technical
writing for any assignment in this course. Instead, this assignment invites you
to submit, using GitHub, the following deliverables.

\vspace*{-.05in}

\begin{enumerate}

\setlength{\itemsep}{0in}

\item Stored in \reflection{}, a multiple-paragraph reflection on the commands
  that you typed in the terminal window and the Java source code that you wrote
  in your text editor. This Markdown-based document should explain the input,
  output, and behavior of each command (e.g., \command{gradle build}) and the
  challenges that you confronted when using it. For every technical challenge
  that you encountered, please explain your solution for it.

\item A properly documented, well-formatted, and correct version of
  \mainprogramsource{} that both meets all of the established requirements and
  produces the desired output.

\end{enumerate}

\vspace*{-.1in}

\section*{Evaluation of Your Laboratory Assignment}

\marginnote{\caution{Request feedback}}[.8in] Using a report that the instructor
shares with you through the commit log in GitHub, you will privately received a
grade on this assignment and feedback on your submitted deliverables. Your grade
for the assignment will be a function of the whether or not it was submitted in
a timely fashion and if your program received a green \checkmark{} indicating
that it met all of the requirements. Other factors will also influence your
final grade on the assignment. In addition to studying the efficiency and
effectiveness and documentation of your Java source code, the instructor will
also evaluate the correctness of your technical writing. If your submission
receives a red \naughtmark{}, the instructor will reduce your grade for the
assignment. Please remember to read your GitHub repository's \program{README.md}
file for a description of the four grades that you will receive for this
laboratory assignment. Students should follow the instructions in the
\program{README.md} file to ask the instructor to review their assignment and to
provide you with constructive feedback before you submit it for the final
assessment.

\section*{Adhering to the Honor Code}

In adherence to the Honor Code, students should complete this assignment on an
individual basis. While it is appropriate for students in this class to have
high-level conversations about the assignment, it is necessary to distinguish
carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem
with others and the student who produces assignments that are identical to, or
merely variations on, someone else's work. Deliverables (e.g., Java source code
or Markdown-based technical writing) that are nearly identical to the work of
others will be taken as evidence of violating the \mbox{Honor Code}. Please see
the course instructor if you have questions about this policy.

\end{document}
