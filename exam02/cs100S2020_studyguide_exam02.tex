\section*{Introduction}

Requiring students to write answers in Markdown, the final examination for this
course will be administered through GitHub Classroom and GitHub. You will
receive access to the online examination on \releasedtime{} on
\assignmentassignedate{}, 2020.
%
Although the course instructor anticipates that the examination will require
students to dedicate about three hours to its completion, every student will
have until \duetime{} on May 4, 2020 to submit their final examination.
%
The exam will be ``closed notes'' and ``closed book'' and it will cover the
following materials. Please review the ``Course Schedule'' on the Web site for
the course to see the content and slides that we have covered to this date.
Students may post questions about this material to our Slack workspace. The
instructor encourages students to form online study groups to review for this
upcoming examination.

\begin{itemize}

  \itemsep 0in

  \item Chapter One in Lewis \& Loftus (i.e., ``Introduction to Computation and Programming'')

  \item Chapter Two in Lewis \& Loftus, Sections 2.1--2.9 (i.e., ``Data and Expressions'')

  \item Chapter Three in Lewis \& Loftus, Sections 3.1--3.7 (i.e., ``Using Classes and Objects'')

  \item Chapter Four in Lewis \& Loftus, Sections 4.1--4.9 (i.e., ``Writing Classes'')

  \item Chapter Five in Lewis \& Loftus, Sections 5.1--5.6 (i.e., ``Conditionals and Loops'')

  \item Chapter Six in Lewis \& Loftus, Sections 6.1--6.4 (i.e., ``More Conditionals and Loops'')

  \item Chapter Eight in Lewis \& Loftus, Sections 8.1--8.4 (i.e., ``Arrays'')

  \item Using the many commands on your laptop's operating system; source code
    editing, compiling and executing programs in Docker; knowledge of the basic
    commands for using GitHub.

  \item Your class notes and lecture slides, labs 1--8, practicals 1--8, and the
    assignment handouts.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Like the past quiz and exam, this exam will be a mix of questions that
have a form such as fill in the blank, short answer, true/false, and completion.
The emphasis will be on the following topics:

\vspace*{-.05in}
\begin{itemize}

  \itemsep 0in

  \item Fundamental concepts in computing and the Java language (e.g., definitions and background).

  \item Fundamental concepts in programming languages (e.g., conditional logic
    and iteration).

  \item Practical laboratory techniques (e.g., editing, compiling, and running
    programs; effectively using files and directories; correctly using GitHub
    through the command-line {\tt git} program).

  \item Understanding Java programs (e.g., given a short, perhaps even one line, source code segment written in Java,
    understand what it does and be able to precisely describe its output).

  \item Composing Java statements and programs, given a description of what should be done. Students should be completely
    comfortable writing short source code statements that are in nearly correct form as Java code. While your program may
    contain small syntactic errors, it is not acceptable to ``make up'' features of the Java programming language that do
    not exist in the language itself---so, please do not call a ``{\tt solveQuestionThree()}'' method!

\end{itemize}

% \noindent No partial credit will be given for questions that are true/false,
% completion, or fill in the blank. Minimal partial credit may be awarded for the
% questions that require a student to write a short answer. You are strongly
% encouraged to write short, precise, and correct responses to all of the
% questions. When you are taking the exam, you should do so as a ``point
% maximizer'' who first responds to the questions that you are most likely to
% answer correctly for full points. Please make sure that you review the past
% assessments so that you can comfortably answer their questions. Students should
% keep the time limitation in mind as they are absolutely required to submit the
% examination at the end of the period unless they have written permission for
% extra time from a member of the Learning Commons. Students who do not submit
% their exam on time will have their overall point total reduced. Please see the
% instructor if you have questions about these policies.

\section*{Reminder Concerning the Honor Code}

\noindent Students are required to fully adhere to the Honor Code during the
completion of this exam. More details about the Allegheny College Honor Code are
provided on the syllabus. Students are strongly encouraged to carefully review
the full statement of the Honor Code before taking this exam. Prior to taking
the examination, please review the Honor Code statement from the course
syllabus.
%
Students who have questions about Allegheny College's Honor Code and how it
applies to the completion of a quiz or an examination in Computer Science 100,
should immediately communication with the course instructor through Slack to
discuss their questions and concerns.

% The Academic Honor Program that governs the entire academic program at Allegheny
% College is described in the Allegheny Academic Bulletin. The Honor Program
% applies to all work that is submitted for academic credit or to meet non-credit
% requirements for graduation at Allegheny College. This includes all work
% assigned for this class (e.g., examinations, laboratory assignments, and the
% final project). All students who have enrolled in the College will work under
% the Honor Program. Each student who has matriculated at the College has
% acknowledged the following pledge:

%\begin{quote}
%%
%  I hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as defined in
%  the Honor Code, and to maintain the integrity of both myself and the College
%  community as a whole.
%%
%\end{quote}
